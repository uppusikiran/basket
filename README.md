README - Fruit Basket Analysis
This Python script analyzes data about fruits in a CSV file and provides various statistics and information about the fruits in the basket.

Code Explanation:
The code consists of a Python script (solution.py) that performs the following tasks:

1. Loading the Fruit Basket Data:
#Python code
def load_fruit_basket(file_name):
    try:
        df = pd.read_csv(file_name)
        return df
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"File '{file_name}' not found.")
        return None
This function reads the data from a CSV file specified as an argument and returns a pandas DataFrame containing the fruit basket data. It handles the case where the file does not exist by printing an error message and returning None.

2. Main Analysis:
Python

def main(file_name):
    basket = load_fruit_basket(file_name)

    if basket is not None:
        # ... Analysis code ...
The main function serves as the entry point for the analysis. It loads the fruit basket data using the load_fruit_basket function and proceeds with the analysis if the data is successfully loaded.

3. Analyzing the Fruit Basket Data:
Python

        total_fruits = basket['Fruit'].count()
        total_types = basket['Fruit'].nunique()
        fruits_count = basket['Fruit'].value_counts().sort_values(ascending=False)
These lines of code calculate various statistics about the fruit basket:

total_fruits: Total number of fruits in the basket.
total_types: Total number of unique fruit types.
fruits_count: Number of each type of fruit, sorted in descending order of occurrence.
4. Displaying Analysis Results:
python

        print(f"Total number of fruit: {total_fruits}")
        print(f"Types of fruit: {total_types}")
        print("The number of each type of fruit in descending order:")
        for fruit, count in fruits_count.items():
            print(f"{fruit}: {count}")
These lines print out the analysis results to the console, including the total number of fruits, the number of fruit types, and the count of each type of fruit in descending order.

5. Fruit Characteristics and Aging Analysis:
python

        print("The characteristics (size, color, shape, etc.) of each fruit by type:")
        fruit_characteristics = basket.groupby('Fruit')['Characteristics'].apply(lambda x: ', '.join(x.unique()))
        for fruit, characteristics in fruit_characteristics.items():
            print(f"{fruits_count[fruit]} {fruit}s: {characteristics}")

        old_fruits = basket[basket['Days in Basket'] > 3]
        if not old_fruits.empty:
            print("\nHave any fruit been in the basket for over 3 days")
            for fruit, count in old_fruits['Fruit'].value_counts().items():
                print(f"{count} {fruit}s are over 3 days old")
These sections of code provide additional analysis:

The characteristics of each fruit type, such as size, color, and shape, are displayed.
Fruits that have been in the basket for over 3 days are identified and printed.
6. Command-Line Usage:
Python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Usage: python solution.py <file_name>")
    else:
        file_name = sys.argv[1]
        main(file_name)
This code block ensures that the script can be run from the command line, taking a CSV file containing fruit data as an argument.

Running the Script:
To use the script, follow these steps:

Save your fruit basket data in a CSV file.

Run the script from the command line, passing the CSV file as an argument:

bash

python solution.py basket.csv
The script will load the data, perform the analysis, and display the results in the console.

Dependencies:
The script depends on the pandas library for data manipulation and reading CSV files. Make sure you have pandas installed before running the script. You can install it using pip install pandas.
